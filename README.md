I'm ~~a 360° all-around universal robot sent from the future~~ searching for a spiritual balance between iron and rust

* ☸️ I write code by day and keep it running by night (other way around would violate the harmony in the universe)
* 🦀 I currently prefer writing Rust because apparently I enjoy fighting the borrow checker for sport
* 🎭 Built [lane.id](https://lane.id) - an IdP provider (because OpenID Connect wasn't complicated enough already)
* 📮 Also made [shovel.mx](https://shovel.mx) - an MTA (mail goes in, mail goes out, I can't explain why)
* 🌭 My dream: 
```rust
loop {
    sleep().await;
    money += 1;
}
```
