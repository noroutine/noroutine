# Hey there 👋

I'm ~~a 360° all-around universal robot sent from the future~~ searching for a spiritual balance between iron and rust

* ☸️ By day, I wear three hats: developer, devops, and SRE (in any combination, four if you count "professional YAML archaeologist")
* 🦀 I currently prefer writing Rust because apparently I enjoy fighting the borrow checker for sport
* 🎭 Built [lane.id](https://lane.id) - an IdP provider (because OpenID Connect wasn't complicated enough already)
* 📮 Also made [shovel.mx](https://shovel.mx) - an MTA (mail goes in, mail goes out, I can't explain why)
* 🌭 My dream: `while(sleeping){money++;}`

---

*Powered by Google, caffeine, and an unreasonable amount of YAML*
